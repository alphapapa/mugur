# Mugur

An Emacs configurator for [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) compatible
keyboards.

# How it works

Given a list of all the layers and keys, `mugur-mugur` generates the equivalent
C code for the qmk_firmware, ready to be built and flashed on the keyboard.

```emacs-lisp
(mugur-mugur
 '(("base"    a b c (LT numbers d))
   ("numbers" 1 2 3 "one two three")))
```

This is a two-layers layout for a keyboard with four keys. The "base" layer has
the letters 'a', 'b' and 'c' and a layer-toggle key that activates the "numbers"
layer when held and sends the letter 'd' when tapped. On the "numbers" layer
there are the 1, 2 and 3 digits, as expected, and then a macro key that sends
"one two three" when pressed.

There are other possibilities, qmk features and configurations to try, but that
is the basics of it. See [an extended example for
ergodox](#an-extended-example-for-ergodox) for a more rich mugur layout.

# Supported QMK keycodes and features

mugur-key is just a term I've invented for any of the symbols, characters,
strings or lists that can appear in a mugur-keymap. In the above example, both
'a' and "one two three" are valid mugur-keys.

## Basic Keycodes
Mugur supports all the [basic qmk
keycodes](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes_basic).  Their mugur-key equivalent is
either a symbol, a digit, a character or a string.

The mugur-keys are case sensitive, c and C being different mugur-keys, one for the
letter 'c', the other for the Ctrl modifier. Below is the list of all modifiers
plus some additional examples.

| mugur-key | qmk-keycode | comment                             |
|:----------|:------------|-------------------------------------|
| C         | KC_LCTL     | the C (or Ctrl) modifier            |
| M         | KC_LALT     | the M (or Meta) modifier            |
| G         | KC_LGUI     | the G (or Super) modifier           |
| S         | KC_LSFT     | the S (or Shift) modifier           |
| c         | KC_C        | the letter c, given as a symbol     |
| "x"       | KC_X        | the letter x, given as a string     |
| ?\+       | KC_PLUS     | the plus sign, given as a character |
| f12       | KC_F12      | the function key F12                |
| 9         | KC_9        | the digit 9                         |
| xx        | nil         | Invalid key, results in error       |

For every mugur-key there is either a direct correspondence with a qmk-keycode
or with a qmk functionality (like a macro, for example). For a list of all these
basic codes that one can use in the layout, consult the `mugur-symbol` function
as defined in mugur.el. For the special keys, like macros, one-shot and the
rest, see below.

## Mod-tap
When pressed, the modifier is active, when tapped the key is sent.

| mugur-key | example comment                              |
|:----------|:---------------------------------------------|
| (C x)     | Ctrl modifier when held, send x when tappend |
| (S x)     | Hold Shift when held, send x when tapped     |
| (C M x)   | C+M modifier when held, send x when tapped   |
| (C M)     | Invalid, two modifiers given                 |
| (C a b)   | Invalid, more than one key given             |
|           |                                              |

## Modifiers
Allows key combinations like the familiar emacs's M-x, that is, hold down the
Meta modifier and press x.

| mugur-key | example comment                          |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------|
| M-x       | Send x with Meta held down               |
| C-M-x     | Send x with both Ctrl and Meta held down |
| C-M-yes   | Invalid keycode, results in error        |

## One Shot Keys
One shot keys are keys that remain active until the next key is pressed, and
then are released ([qmk documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/one_shot_keys))

| mugur-key     | example comment                                               |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| (OSM S)       | One Shot Mod - the next key will be pressed with Shift active |
| (OSL mylayer) | One Shot Layer - the next key will be from this layer         |

## Layer Toggle
Switching and toggling layers. 

| mugur-key      | example comment                                                                             |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (DF numbers)   | switch to 'numbers' layer                                                                   |
| (MO numbers)   | momentarily activates the 'numbers' layer (as long as the key is kept pressed)              |
| (LM numbers C) | momentarily activates the 'numbers' layer but with the C modifier active                    |
| (LT numbers x) | momentarily activates the 'numbers' layer when held and sends x when tapped                 |
| (OSL numbers)  | momentarily activates the 'numbers' layer until the next key is pressed                     |
| (TG numbers)   | toggle the numbers layer, activating it if its inactive and vice-versa                      |
| (TO numbers)   | activates the numbers layer and deactivates all the other layers, besides the default layer |
| (TT numbers)   | layer tap-toggle                                                                            |

## Macros
Send any key combination that does not qualify as anything else.

| mugur-key               | example comment                                                                   |
|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "this is mugur!"        | send the specified string when key is tapped                                      |
| (C-x d)                 | send x with C modifier pressed and then send d. (the Emacs dired command)         |
| (C-M-u "my pass" enter) | send u with both C and M modifier pressed, send "my pass" and press enter         |
| ">"                     | this is *not* a macro since it has a basic qmk-keycode to which it is transformed |
| "Î»"                     | but this one is a macro, and this key will insert the beloved lambda              |
| (C-x dd)                | invalid, since dd is not a valid mugur-key. Results in error                      |

## Emacs keybound functions
For Emacs functions that have a keybinding, the function name can be directly specified as a mugur-key.

| mugur-keycode | example comment                                                                     |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| query-replace | the usual keybinding for this is M-%, so this is equivalent with the M-% mugur-key  |
| insert-char   | Becomes the mugur-key '(C-x 8 RET), which, in turn, is a macro that send those keys |
|               |                                                                                     |

## User Defined Keys
For long or often-used mugur-key sequences, or simply as a mnemonic, the
`mugur-user-defined-keys` contains a list of items, where the car of the item is
the mnemonic and the cadr is any valid mugur-key.

```emacs-list
(setf mugur-user-define-keys
      '((uname        "my_badass_username")
        (weird_key    (C-c a "right?" ENT))))
```

# Supported Keyboards

Any keyboard that uses the QMK firmware. Users have reported success using mugur
for the following keyboards,

| QMK Keyboard | Comments |
|:-------------|:---------|
| Ergodox (EZ) |          |

Send me an email if you've used mugur for other keyboards successfully. If
you have problems with a particular keyboard, open an issue with the keyboard
name and the particular problem you're facing.

# Other points

* Not all qmk features are supported, nor there is a plan to support them all.
* The layout structure that mugur accepts is the layout that qmk keymap.c is
  using for your particular keyboard (check the qmk_firmware sourcecode). There
  is a one-to-one correspondence to what is defined in a mugur-layout and what
  you see in the qmk-layout. In short, no vertical or horizontal reordering of
  the keys is supported nor planned to.
* There is no support to define which LEDs to turn on/off for which mugur-layer,
  nor there is a plan to support such a feature.
* The mugur package generates the qmk-layout, but does not build nor flashes it
  on your keyboard. The layout name and location is based on the values of the
  custom variables given by the user (see the [configuration](#Configuration)
  section). Consult the qmk documentation and your keyboard README for how to
  build and flash your keyboard.
